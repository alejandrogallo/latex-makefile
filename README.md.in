# The ultimate TeX Makefile #

## Installing ##

Just get a built makefile from
[the latest release](
https://github.com/alejandrogallo/latex-makefile/releases/latest
) and put it in your TeX project folder.

## Building ##

To build you have to initialize the submodules:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

and then just hit

```
make
```
You will need the macro processor `m4`.


## Quick start ##

Just drop the Makefile in your project directory and hit make.  The makefile
should recognise the main document automatically by looking for a
`\begin{document}` in the `tex` file of the current directory.

The main idea of the makefile is not to modify it directly, but rather through
a `make` configuration file `config.mk`. There you can set many important
variables for the project, like the verbosity `QUIET=1` and many more.
